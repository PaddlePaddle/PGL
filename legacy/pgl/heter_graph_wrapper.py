    Args:
        name: The heterogeneous graph data prefix

        node_feat: A dict of list of tuples that decribe the details of node
                   feature tenosr. Each tuple mush be (name, shape, dtype)
                   and the first dimension of the shape must be set unknown
                   (-1 or None) or we can easily use :code:`HeterGraph.node_feat_info()`
                   to get the node_feat settings.
