This file contains some test graphs and meshes

4elt.graph
copter2.graph
mdual.graph
	These are small to medium size graphs corresponding to 2D and 3D 
        finite element mesh. They can be used as inputs to gpmetis and ndmetis.

test.mgraph
	This is a very small graph with two vertex weights (multi-constraint).
        Can be used as input to gpmetis.

metis.mesh
	This is a small 2D mesh (It is a triangulation of 'METIS').
        Can be used as input to mpmetis and m2gmetis.
