Building GKlib requires CMake 2.8. Once you've installed CMake run

    $ make

This will build the GKlib library in build/<arch>/. Options can be tweaked by
running make config. For example,

    $ make config openmp=ON
    $ make

will build GKlib will OpenMP support if it is available.

GKlib can be installed with

    $ make install

and uninstalled with

    $ make uninstall

You can choose the installation prefix with make config:

    $ make config prefix=~/local

will cause GKlib to be install in the ~/local tree.
