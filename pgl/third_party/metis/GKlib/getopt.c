Describe how to deal with options that follow non-option ARGV-elements.

If the caller did not specify anything, the default is REQUIRE_ORDER if 
the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, PERMUTE otherwise.

REQUIRE_ORDER means don't recognize them as options; stop option processing 
when the first non-option is seen.  This is what Unix does.  This mode of 
operation is selected by either setting the environment variable 
POSIXLY_CORRECT, or using `+' as the first character of the list of 
option characters.

PERMUTE is the default.  We permute the contents of ARGV as we scan, so 
that eventually all the non-options are at the end.  This allows options
to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written to
expect this.

RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were written
to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order and that care 
about the ordering of the two.  We describe each non-option ARGV-element
as if it were the argument of an option with character code 1.
Using `-' as the first character of the list of option characters
selects this mode of operation.

The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless
of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only
`--' can cause `getopt' to return -1 with `gk_optind' != ARGC.

/*
   Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `gk_optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns -1.
   Then `gk_optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `gk_opterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `gk_optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in `gk_optarg', otherwise `gk_optarg' is set to zero.

   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.

   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
   from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
   When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
   `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
   if the `flag' field is zero.

   LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct gk_option' terminated by an
   element containing a name which is zero.

   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
   recent call.

   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce
   long-named options.

/*************************************************************************/
/*! \brief Parse command-line arguments

The gk_getopt() function gets the next option argument from the argument 
list specified by the \c argv and \c argc arguments. Normally these values 
come directly from the arguments received by main().

\param argc is the number of command line arguments passed to main().
\param argv is an array of strings storing the above command line 
       arguments.
\param options is a string that specifies the option characters that 
       are valid for this program. An option character in this string 
       can be followed by a colon (`:') to indicate that it takes a 
       required argument. If an option character is followed by two 
       colons (`::'), its argument is optional; this is a GNU extension.

\return  
It returns the option character for the next command line option. When no 
more option arguments are available, it returns -1. There may still be 
more non-option arguments; you must compare the external variable 
#gk_optind against the \c argc parameter to check this.

\return  
If the option has an argument, gk_getopt() returns the argument by storing 
it in the variable #gk_optarg. You don't ordinarily need to copy the 
#gk_optarg string, since it is a pointer into the original \c argv array, 
not into a static area that might be overwritten.

\return  
If gk_getopt() finds an option character in \c argv that was not included 
in options, or a missing option argument, it returns `?' and sets the 
external variable #gk_optopt to the actual option character. 
If the first character of options is a colon (`:'), then gk_getopt() 
returns `:' instead of `?' to indicate a missing option argument. 
In addition, if the external variable #gk_opterr is nonzero (which is 
the default), gk_getopt() prints an error message.  This variable is 
set by gk_getopt() to point at the value of the option argument, 
for those options that accept arguments.


gk_getopt() has three ways to deal with options that follow non-options 
\c argv elements. The special argument <tt>`--'</tt> forces in all cases 
the end of option scanning.
  - The default is to permute the contents of \c argv while scanning it 
    so that eventually all the non-options are at the end. This allows 
    options to be given in any order, even with programs that were not 
    written to expect this.
  - If the options argument string begins with a hyphen (`-'), this is 
    treated specially. It permits arguments that are not options to be 
    returned as if they were associated with option character `\\1'.
  - POSIX demands the following behavior: The first non-option stops 
    option processing. This mode is selected by either setting the 
    environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT or beginning the options
    argument string with a plus sign (`+').

/*************************************************************************/
/*! \brief Parse command-line arguments with long options

This function accepts GNU-style long options as well as single-character 
options. 

\param argc is the number of command line arguments passed to main().
\param argv is an array of strings storing the above command line 
       arguments.
\param options describes the short options to accept, just as it does 
       in gk_getopt(). 
\param long_options describes the long options to accept. See the 
       defintion of ::gk_option for more information.
\param opt_index this is a returned variable.  For any long option, 
       gk_getopt_long() tells you the index in the array \c long_options 
       of the options definition, by storing it into <tt>*opt_index</tt>. 
       You can get the name of the option with <tt>longopts[*opt_index].name</tt>. 
       So you can distinguish among long options either by the values 
       in their val fields or by their indices. You can also distinguish 
       in this way among long options that set flags.


\return
When gk_getopt_long() encounters a short option, it does the same thing 
that gk_getopt() would do: it returns the character code for the option, 
and stores the options argument (if it has one) in #gk_optarg.

\return
When gk_getopt_long() encounters a long option, it takes actions based 
on the flag and val fields of the definition of that option.

\return
If flag is a null pointer, then gk_getopt_long() returns the contents 
of val to indicate which option it found. You should arrange distinct 
values in the val field for options with different meanings, so you 
can decode these values after gk_getopt_long() returns. If the long 
option is equivalent to a short option, you can use the short option's 
character code in val.

\return
If flag is not a null pointer, that means this option should just set 
a flag in the program. The flag is a variable of type int that you 
define. Put the address of the flag in the flag field. Put in the 
val field the value you would like this option to store in the flag. 
In this case, gk_getopt_long() returns 0.

\return
When a long option has an argument, gk_getopt_long() puts the argument 
value in the variable #gk_optarg before returning. When the option has 
no argument, the value in #gk_optarg is a null pointer. This is
how you can tell whether an optional argument was supplied.

\return
When gk_getopt_long() has no more options to handle, it returns -1, 
and leaves in the variable #gk_optind the index in argv of the next 
remaining argument.
