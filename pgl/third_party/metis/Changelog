------------------------------------------------------------------------
r13937 | karypis | 2013-03-29 23:08:21 -0500 (Fri, 29 Mar 2013) 

- Further extended the 2-hop coarsening scheme introduced in 5.0.2 for
  for graphs with highly variable degree distribution (e.g., power-law). 
  This coarsening scheme is automatically used when the standard 
  1-hop-based scheme leaves a large fraction of the vertices of the 
  graph unmatched. It leads to better quality partitionings, lower 
  memory utilization, and faster execution time. In principle, this 
  scheme will never be triggered for graphs/matrices appearing in 
  scientific computations derived from FE meshes. However, if you 
  notice that the quality of the solutions is significantly worse, 
  this 2-hop matching can be turned off by using the '-no2hop' command 
  line option and the associated options[] parameter (as described 
  in the manual).
- Fixed 0/1 numbering issue with mesh partitioning routines (flyspray 
   issue #109)


metis-5.0.3

  return nicely and cleanup all memory that may have allocated.
- Reduced memory requirements.
- Fixed various bugs identified in rc1.
- Added back Fortran support in the form of alternate API names
  (see libmetis/frename.h).

metis-5.0rc1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r10227 | karypis | 2011-06-13 23:35:05 -0500 (Mon, 13 Jun 2011)

- A nearly complete re-write of Metis' code-based that changed expanded
  the functionality of the command-line programs and API routines.
- Multi-constraint partitioning can be used in conjunction with
  minimization of the total communication volume.
- All graph and mesh partitioning routines take as input the target
  sizes of the partitions, which among others, allow them to compute
  partitioning solutions that are well-suited for parallel architectures
  with heterogeneous computing capabilities.
- When multi-constraint partitioning is used, the target sizes of the
  partitions are specified on a per partition-constraint pair.
- The multilevel k-way partitioning algorithms can compute a
  partitioning solution in which each partition is contiguous.
- All partitioning and ordering routines can compute multiple different
  solutions and select the best as the final solution.
- The mesh partitioning and mesh-to-graph conversion routines can
  operate on mixed element meshes.
- The command-line programs provide full access to the entire set of
  capabilities provided by Metis' API.
- Re-written the memory management subsystem to reduce overall memory
  requirements.



metis-5.0pre2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1437 | karypis | 2007-04-07 23:16:16 -0500 (Sat, 07 Apr 2007)  

- Added installation instructions and change-logs.
- Tested 32bit & 64bit on 64bit architectures and passed tests.
- Tested 32bit on 32bit architectures and passed tests.
- strtoidx() addition for portable input file parsing
- Restructured the internal memory allocation schemes for graph and
  refinement data. This should enhance portability and make the code
  easier to maintain.
- Fixed some bad memory allocation calls (i.e., sizeof(x)/sizeof(idxtype). 
  However, there are tons of those and need to be corrected once and for
  all by eliminating workspace and the associated mallocs.
- Added mprint/mscanf family of functions for portable formated I/O
  of the idxtype datatype. The specifier for this datatype is %D.
  All library routines use this function for printing. 
  The implementation of these routines is not very efficient, but
  that should do for now (in principle these routines should not be
  used unless debugging).
- Incorporated GKlib into METIS, which replaced many of its internal
  functions. GKlib's malloc interface will enable graceful and clean
  aborts (i.e., free all internally allocated memory) on fatal errors.
  This will probably be available in the next pre-release.
- Fixed the problems associated with metis.h that were identified by
  David (flyspray Issue #9).


METIS 4.0.2, 3/10/04
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a problem with weighted graphs and ometis.c


METIS 4.0.1, 11/29/98
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is mostly a bug-fix release

  - Fixed some bugs in the multi-constraint partitioning routines
  - Fixed some bugs in the volume-minimization routines



METIS 4.0.0, 9/20/98
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
METIS 4.0 contains a number of changes over the previous major release (ver 
3.0.x). Most of these changes are concentrated on the graph and mesh 
partitioning routines and they do not affect the sparse matrix re-ordering 
routines. Here is a list of the major changes:

  Multi-Constraint Partitioning
  -----------------------------
  METIS now includes partitioning routines that can be used to a partition
  a graph in the presence of multiple balancing constraints.

  Minimizing the Total Communication Volume
  -----------------------------------------
  METIS now includes partitioning routines whose objective is to minimize
  the total communication volume (as opposed to minimizing the edge-cut).

  Minimizing the Maximum Connectivity of the Subdomains
  -----------------------------------------------------
  The k-way partitioning routines in METIS can now directly minimize the number
  of adjacent subdomains. For most graphs corresponding to finite element 
  meshes, METIS is able to significantly reduce the maximum (and total) number of 
  adjacent subdomains.




METIS 3.0.6, 1/28/98
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Fixed some problems when too many partitions were asked, and each partition
    end up having 0 vertices
  - Fixed some bugs in the I/O routines
  - Added support for the g77 compiler under Linux


METIS 3.0.5, 12/22/97
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Fixed problems on 64-bit architectures (eg., -64 option on SGIs).
  - Added some options in Makefile.in


METIS 3.0.4, 12/1/97
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fixed a memory leak in the ordering code.


METIS 3.0.3, 11/5/97
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is mostly a bug-fix release with just a few additions

  Added functionality
    - Added support for quadrilateral elements.
    - Added a routine METIS_EstimateMemory that estimates the amount of
      memory that will be allocated by METIS. This is useful in determining
      if a problem can run on your system.
    - Added hooks to allow PARMETIS to use the orderings produced by METIS.
      This is hidden from the user but it will be used in the next release
      of PARMETIS.

  Bug-fixes
    - Fixed a bug related to memory allocation. This should somewhat reduce the 
      overall memory used by METIS.
    - Fixed some bugs in the 'graphchk' program in the case of weighted graphs.
    - Removed some code corresponding to unused options.
    - Fixed some minor bugs in the node-refinement code
      


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
METIS 3.0 contains a number of changes over METIS 2.0.
The major changes are the following:

  General Changes
  ---------------
    1.  Added code to directly partition finite element meshes.

    2.  Added code to convert finite element meshes into graphs so they
        can be used by METIS.

    1.  The names, calling sequences, and options  of the routines in 
        METISlib have been changed.

    2.  Better support has been added for Fortran programs.

    3.  Eliminated the 'metis' program. The only way to tune METIS's
        behavior is to use METISlib.

    4.  Improved memory management. METIS should now only abort if truly
        there is no more memory left in the system.


  Graph Partitioning
  ------------------
    1.  Added partitioning routines that can be used to compute a partition 
        with prescribed partition weights. For example, they can be used to 
        compute a 3-way partition such that partition 1 has 50% of the weight, 
        partition 2 has 20% of the way, and partition 3 has 30% of the weight. 

    2.  Improved the speed of the k-way partitioning algorithm (kmetis). The
        new code has better cache locality which dramatically improves the 
        speed for large graphs. A factor of 4 speedup can be obtained for
        certain graphs. METIS can now partition a 4 million node graph
        in well under a minute on a MIPS R10000.

    3.  Eliminated some of the options that were seldom used. 
  

  Fill-Reducing Orderings
  ----------------------
    1.  Added a node based ordering code `onmetis' that greatly improves 
        ordering quality.

    2.  Improved the quality of the orderings produced by the original
        edge-based ordering code (it is now called 'oemetis').

    3.  METIS can now analyze the graph and try to compress together 
        nodes with identical sparsity pattern. For some problems, this 
        significantly reduces ordering time 

    4.  METIS can now prune dense columns prior to ordering. This can be
        helpful for LP matrices.
        

  Mesh Partitioning
  -----------------
    1.  METIS can now directly partition the element node array of finite
        element meshes. It produces two partitioning vectors. One for the
        elements and one for the nodes. METIS supports the following 
        elements: triangles, tetrahedra, hexahedra


  Mesh-To-Graph Conversion Routines
  ---------------------------------
    1.  METIS now includes a number of mesh conversion functions that can 
        be used to create the dual and nodal graphs directly from the 
        element connectivity arrays. These are highly optimized routines.
