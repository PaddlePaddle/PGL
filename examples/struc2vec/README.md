# Struc2vec: Learning Node Representations from Structural Identity
[Struc2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03165) is is a concept of symmetry in which network nodes are identified according to the network structure and their relationship to other nodes. A novel and flexible framework for learning latent representations is proposed in the paper of struc2vec. We reproduce Struc2vec algorithm in the PGL.

###  DataSet
The paper of use air-traffic network to valid algorithm of Struc2vec.
The each edge in the dataset indicate that having one flight between the airports. Using the the connection between the airports to predict the level of activity. The following dataset will be used to valid the algorithm accuracy.Data collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics2 from January to October, 2016. The network has 1,190 nodes, 13,599 edges (diameter is 8). [Link](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/)

### Dependencies
If use want to use the struc2vec model in pgl, please install the gensim, pathos, fastdtw additional.
- paddlepaddle>=1.6
- pgl
- gensim

- fastdtw

### How to use
For examples, we want to train and valid the Struc2vec model on American airpot dataset 
```python
   python train.py --edge_file input_path/usa-airports.edgelist --label_file input_path/labels-usa-airports.txt --do_train True --opt2 True
```
